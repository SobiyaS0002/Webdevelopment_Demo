# Webdevelopment_Demo 

# Here in this Repo I am learning and implementing HTML and CSS in a most realistic and efficient way.

<p> <pre> First of all what is HTML? 
    In simple words, it is a Hypertext Markup Language which is use to dictate or instruct the web browser for static or dynamic web pages 
</pre> </p>

# The format of this implementation is to follow a utorial with lots of modification in order to learn and adapt{ usually think-out-of-the-box} -- followed by the exercises

# So to begin with, I am creating a file named index.html
